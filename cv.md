About myself:

I am was born in Minsk, Belarus. There i tried to find my own way. I had an amazing experience as a customs officer. This influenced on me and helped to start my way, improved my soft and hard skills. I was inspired enough to learn German and to improve English. So i started my work as casino dealer on a cruise ship. That was so cool and undescribable. I had 2 contracts. But i felt that my search is not completed. 
I am wondering, how computer is working. So i tried to look for the information. Luckily i found rs-school and my way began.
